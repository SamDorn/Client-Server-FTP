## What is it?
Is a client-server architecture where clients can upload and download files to and from the server, similar to the FTP protocol. <br>
There are 2 application, a server.exe and a client.exe. The server is the one to receive and send files when requested and the client is the one
who can upload and download files.

## What does it do?

Once the server is listening for connections, the clients can connect, upload and download files. <br>
The uploaded files will be saved in CLient-Server-FTP\Server\Server\bin\debug\net6.0\files <br>
The downloaded files will be saved in the folder you select.

## How does it work?

Both server and client are written in ___C#___.The only difference is that the client is a windows form, meanwhile the server is a console application. It uses socket to communicate and send files.
